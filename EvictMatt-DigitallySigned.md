# Termination of monthly Tenancy for Norman Matt Insley of [REDACTED], Portland, Oregon, [REDACTED]

Sunday, November 7, 2021

Posted at his door and mailed first class to residence address. Attempts to serve via Multnomah
Country Civil Court will also be pursued as well as options approved by 90.150 (1-4) per the
advice of Portland Police. However, per ORS 91.110 ‘Notices to be in writing’ stipulates “All
notices required by ORS 91.050 (Tenancy at will) to 91.070 (Tenancy from month to month) and
by ORS 105.120 (Notice necessary to maintain action in certain cases), must be in writing and
must be served upon the tenant by being delivered to the tenant in person or by being posted
in a conspicuous place on the leased premises in case of the absence of the tenant, or by being
left at the residence or place of abode.

Pursuant to several Oregon Statutes including but not limited to ORS 90.396, ORS 90.325, ORS
90.453, & ORS 166.155/166.165, Norman Matt Insley is hereby served with a 24-hour notice to
vacate for (multiple) cause(s).

Specifically:

Tenant has, despite multiple repeated entreaties, failed to:

90.325(b) Keep all areas of the premises under control of the tenant in every part as clean,
sanitary and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents and
vermin, as the condition of the premises permits and to the extent that the tenant is
responsible for causing the problem. The tenant shall cooperate to a reasonable extent in
assisting the landlord in any reasonable effort to remedy the problem.

90.325 (c ) Dispose from the dwelling unit all ashes, garbage, rubbish and other waste in a
clean, safe and legal manner…

90.325
(g) Behave and require other persons on the premises with the consent of the tenant to behave
in a manner that will not disturb the peaceful enjoyment of the premises by neighbors.

Additionally:

90.412 (4) (b) The violation concerns the tenant’s conduct and, following the violation but
prior to acceptance of rent for three rental periods or performance as described in
subsection (2) of this section, the landlord gives a written warning notice to the tenant
regarding the violation that:

(A)Describes specifically the conduct that constitutes the violation, either as a separate and
distinct violation, a series or group of violations or a continuous or ongoing violation;

(B)States that the tenant is required to discontinue the conduct or correct the violation; and

To wit: your vile, hostile, and abusive conduct toward me Friday, November 5th, over
several hours between 5 PM and ongoing past midnight, wherein I was forced to physically
defend myself, a severely disabled woman, against your continued aggressions and despite
multiple entreaties and warnings to cease, desist, disengage or otherwise immediately stop
approaching my person or my doorway. You aggressively breached my bedroom door
shortly before 9 PM and advanced toward me in a threatening manner. Pepper spray was
deployed to your face, which had the desired effect of temporarily ending your attack,
although I myself was affected and injured by the spray being in my sleeping quarters.
Emergency services were summoned at 9:01 PM. Responding officers approximately 1
hour later failed to protect me, the victim of your domestic violence (notwithstanding the
nature of our acquaintance which is non-sexual).

Further, your conduct was such that it is clearly and unquestionably a violation of ORS
166.165 and/or ORS 166.155 “Bias crime in the first (or second) degree”

(1)A person commits a bias crime in the first degree if the person:

(a)Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes physical injury to another person because
of the person’s perception of the other person’s race, color, religion, gender identity,
sexual orientation, disability or national origin;

(b)With criminal negligence causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly
weapon because of the person’s perception of the other person’s race, color, religion,
gender identity, sexual orientation, disability or national origin; or

(c)Intentionally, because of the person’s perception of another person’s race, color,
religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, places another
person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.

(2)A bias crime in the first degree is a Class C felony. [1981 c.785 §2; 1983 c.521 §2; 1989
c.1029 §2; 1993 c.332 §1; 1995 c.79 §53; 1997 c.249 §50; 2007 c.100 §19; 2011 c.421 §2;
2019 c.553 §2]

[I note that the word ‘gender’ appears to be a substitute for ‘sex’ in the statute, and it is
defined by ORS 174.100 (7) “Sexual orientation” means an individual’s actual or perceived
heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality or gender identity, regardless of whether the
individual’s gender identity, appearance, expression or behavior differs from that
traditionally associated with the individual’s sex at birth.

Specifically, vile and misogynistic and ableist abuses were repeatedly issued via typed
chat, as well as audibly overheard in your continued attempts to intimidate. I cannot tally
up the number of times you slurred me verbally, but it was vehement, repeated several
times at varying volumes, either you possibly talking to others, to yourself, or to your
neglected cat Mr. Peepers. In the chat archives, the slur ‘fat’ appears no less than 25 times.
‘Hypochondriac’ appears 3 times. ‘Disabled’, specifically your false accusations that I am
not, appear 8 times. ‘Disability’ appears 7 times. ‘Bitch’ appears just once in writing,
following the visit by Police, but was audible in your vile, misogynistic rants countless
times as witnessed by myself and by Justin Hall. ‘Cunt’ appears 5 times and was also heard
countless times. ‘Lazy’ appears 7 times.

Threats were issued by you to jeopardize my status as a client seeking services and
assistance, to wit, you repeatedly threatened to LIE to everyone about my overall condition.
Other slurs including ‘bully’ ‘belligerent’ ‘nasty’ ‘stubborn’ ‘freak’ ‘manipulative’
‘conniving’, ‘unhinged’ etcetera.

Additionally, Matt repeatedly and aggressively placed objects/items outside my door,
continuing even after I reminded him of my mobility issues that these were trip hazards. I
removed food and other objects no less than 5 times, to which he responded with laughter
that can only be described as ‘maniacal’. Matt was also cautioned that his hostile abuse
could subject me to stroke or heart attack due to multiple concurrent disabilities and health
concerns.

Your attack temporarily stopped between the 9 PM pepper spray and resumed
IMMEDIATELY after the Police left at 10:30 PM. You lied about their conduct, as
confirmed in a subsequent call with one responding officer.

Matt paid $400 rent in cash to Justin Hall and it has been forwarded to the property owner.
Matt may avail himself of court should he feel entitled to these monies; however while
payment entitles him to occupy the rented bedroom, his abusive conduct has now voided
his rights as a tenant and he, in my opinion, forfeits these monies. Additionally, he owes
me a debt that although the complete tally has not been tabulated, it currently stands at just
under $900, inclusive of an existing prior installment debt and factoring in my care and
feeding of his ESA cat Mr. Peepers, wherein while I never agreed to pay for expenses other
than neutering, as a conscientious person I did not deny food to the animal despite Matt’s
irresponsible misuse of any personal funds that were spent on vices he placed as superior
to his animal’s survival.

Norman Matt Insley is hereby notified he must vacate per established Oregon law for his
egregious acts.
